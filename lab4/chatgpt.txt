Which foods lack the 3 amino acids?



Short answer: no normal whole foods “lack” specific amino acids entirely. Almost every natural food with any protein has all amino acids in some amount. If your top 3 (from the codon results) are the usual suspects for SARS-CoV-2 in a simple frame-0 count—phenylalanine (F), leucine (L), and serine (S)—then the way to “avoid” them is to choose foods that are very low in protein overall.

Here are practical picks that are naturally very low in phenylalanine, leucine, and serine (because they’re low in total protein):

Fruits: apples, pears, grapes, peaches, watermelon, berries, citrus.

Non-starchy vegetables: lettuce, cucumber, zucchini, bell pepper, tomato, celery.

Starchy vegetables with modest protein: potatoes, carrots, beets (still much lower than grains/legumes/meat).

Refined carbs & sugars: white sugar, honey, jam, plain rice cakes (little to no protein).

Fats & oils: olive oil, sunflower oil, butter (essentially zero protein → essentially zero F/L/S).

Starches like tapioca/arrowroot: mostly carbohydrate, minimal protein.

If you’re trying to minimize those three amino acids in meals, prioritize plates built from the lists above and limit high-protein foods (meat, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, tofu/tempeh, nuts/seeds, whole grains).
